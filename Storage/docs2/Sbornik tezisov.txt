the noted allows you to make a timely decision on the management and control of the development of oil and gas fields not only by regulating the waterflooding process but also by sampling by groups of wells as a whole for the deposit one of the main issues of the oil production process is the timely regulation of both current withdrawals and the process of water impact on the reservoir system the oscillatory nature of the time series of measurements of oil water and liquid production rates carries information about the state and behavior of the reservoir system analysis of the features of oscillatory processes of well operation technological indicators located throughout the entire area of the deposit as a whole allows for early diagnosis of changes in the state of the reservoir temperature layers of these deposits were developed the technology developed on the basis of the received compositions is based on injecting a composition consisting of a solution of crystallite reagent in formation water into the layer forming gel and sediment isolating the water highly conductive channels of the formation entering the areas of the reservoir that were not previously covered by the impact and forcing oil from the stagnant zones thus the analysis of literature indicators allows us to say that research works in the field of formation of stagnant zones in layers and reduction of their sizes are mainly theoretical in nature in these studies when discussing the causes of formation of stagnant zones in the formation first of all the structural %) 1 2 3 4 5 7 1 44 80

isolation work conducted with this technology is not strong enough for this reason using the components of this composition laboratory studies to find a new effective composition were conducted first the composition consisting of dispersant and soluble silicate in different proportions was observed a special experimental device was assembled in order to determine the efficiency of water isolating works in a porous environment using the developed composition the scheme of the device is shown in figure 1 the device consists of the following main parts mechanical properties of oil the heterogeneity of formation rocks the pattern arrangement the value of the pressure gradient within the formation etc are indicated taking into account that the issue is of high practical importance a reservoir model simulated on real reservoir conditions expecting similarity criteria should be prepared using the results of the series of experimental studies to be carried out in the model developing and applying the technology will allow the extraction of large volumes of oil concentrated in the stagnant zones formed in the old fields of azerbaijan list of used literature 1 bernadiner m g on the limiting configuration of stagnant zones during the displacement of viscous therefore it is important to study the mechanism of the effect of the oil and water mobility coefficient reservoir heterogeneity instability of the displacement front development system as a whole density and configuration of the well network including vertical deviated horizontal wells of complex architecture in combination with various modifications of hydraulic fracturing on the process of unsteady flooding the conceptual basis of the proposed system optimization of waterflooding at the late stage of development is the solution of a number of theoretical and experimental problems that allow to mobilize injected water not only by regulating the operating modes of interacting 159 production and injection wells but also to optimize the system “ rpm it allows you to take into account the possibility of complications when choosing modes of further operation plan the necessary preventive measures etc at the same time in the initial period of destruction its effect on the operation of wells is insignificant and it is not possible to catch it using traditional research methods as a rule only after a certain period when the process of sand removal progresses and has a rather noticeable effect on the operation of the well it is concluded that complications which naturally become much more difficult to prevent are possible frequency characteristics of simultaneously operating wells to the entire exploitation object as a whole this approach makes it possible to make a decision on the regulation of various processes not for individual wells but for groups of wells that statistically randomly cover the formation area the composition of the groups changes over time due to the transition of wells from one group to another thus the proposed approach makes it possible to take into account not only the heterogeneity of the system but also the effect of non state even if the reservoir oil has newtonian properties corner areas and stagnant zones may form where the oil cannot be completely displaced most oil fields are heterogeneous due to permeability inhomogeneity can vary both linearly and across the field therefore although the pressure gradient remains constant the seepage resistance will vary in different areas of the layer depending on the shape of the inhomogeneities and their location the percolation rate will also vary in this regard the degree of development м3 1 2 3 4 5 1 44 80 0 00 44 80 0 00 2 42 37 0 00 42 70 1 00 3 39 94 0 00 40 60 2 00 4

the well which lasts for a rather long period diagnosing this qualitative leap and changing the nature of the well operation mode by fluctuations in its productivity would make it possible to conclude that the damage of the bottomhole zone has begun this problem can be solved based on the application of the theory of catastrophes porous medium 1 m long it consists of a glass model filled with quartz sand the clear nature of the model allows the displacement boundary of the water isolating material to be observed throughout the model after the porous medium is prepared it is filled with water under vacuum then the treated composition is sequentially injected into the output part of the model corresponding to the production well in the experiments soluble silicate was prepared from aqueous solutions of different concentrations the development of oil fields is a complex process regulated by complex works such as compacting a well pattern carrying out a wide range of geological and technical activities etc from this point of view the development and operation of fields needs a “ volumetric ” approach which is the “ diffusion approximation ” which makes it possible to take into account the change in the characteristics of the reservoir over the cross section in time i e track the change in the diffusion coefficient permeability zones of the formation remained undeveloped therefore such a technology that reduces the intensive movement of the working agent injected into the formation to the washed areas of the formation should be developed and can enter the areas that have not been covered by the impact and remained in the form of stagnant zones of oil and improve the displacement of oil from there the indicators obtained from the researches related to the displacement of oil from layered and non in the modern world the development of oil and gas extraction is one of the priority directions in the countries rich in hydrocarbon deposits since azerbaijan is one of the countries in this series it is inevitable that this problem should be a priority direction as well for this reason many technologies and methods which serve to intensify oil production and increase oil extraction have been developed by specialists in this field in our country most of azerbaijan to describe the process of oil fields development currently the analysis of the interaction of wells in the process of developing oil fields is based in particular on the calculation of the correlation coefficient of two adjacent wells however due to the reservoir heterogeneity this approach does not allow taking into account the possibility of interaction between wells located at significantly greater distances v x t decreases with increasing t the presented model corresponds to dynamical systems with invariable properties in a more general case the system and accordingly the function may depend on a number of parameters 1 2 k c c c in fact this
