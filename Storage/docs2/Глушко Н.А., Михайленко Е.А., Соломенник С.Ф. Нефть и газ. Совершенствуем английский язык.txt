contact with water – sulfur compounds may provide corrosion protection when stable sulfide layers form on the metal surface 3 a safety while proper equipment design materials selection and corrosion control can result in monetary savings a perhaps more important reason for corrosion control is safety hydrogen sulfide h2s is a common component of many produced fluids it is poisonous to humans and it also causes a variety of environmental cracking problems the proper selection of h2s pressors are used to introduce gas from multiple gathering lines into a transmission line because of the friction that occurs when a fluid flows within a pipeline gas pressure drops with distance and must be boosted this is achieved by building additional compressor stations every 50 – 100 miles at these stations well above the russian average – the average depth of baku oil wells doubled from 1878 through 1886 from 301 to 609 feet with wells being drilled to depth up to 1 120 feet 6 base – the
